//! SearchType 

Maintainability and Readability: Using SearchType makes the code more readable and maintainable.
 For instance, instead of checking if searchType == "name", we use searchType == SearchType.name,
  which is more descriptive and resistant to typos.

Error Prevention: Enums prevent invalid values. If a new search type needs to be added,
 adding a new case to the enum will update the code everywhere itâ€™s used, reducing the chance of errors.

The horizontal row of ChoiceChip widgets allows users to select a search type visually.
When a ChoiceChip is selected, it updates _searchType, clears the search controller,
and triggers a fresh filtering to display results matching the new search type.
